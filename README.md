-Added new navigation bar.
-Updated About page, c.v. page
-Updated styling on index page for small screens

-Added trial of a slick carousel in "slick-trial" on the slick.html page.
Carousel works but needs to be refined.

-Improved home page and navigation bar.

-Used Foundation's grid system to lay-out CV and about page. Improved styling and added a logo
 on navigation bar. Adapted page layout for different media queries. Cleaned up CSS sheets a little.
  Added new fonts.

 -Added test files for using Slick carousel on the portfolio pages. CSS for Slick and previous pages are conflicting. 

 -Made modifications to Slick carousel on the slick2.html test page. Added a footer.

 -Updated scripts from Foundation 4 to Foundation 5 to get drop-down nav-bar links to work. Renamed the slick2.html page to portfolio1.html. Something in foundation.css is preventing the pages from scrolling since updating scripts.
